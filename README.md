Small Batch Sizes, Big Results
Unlike traditional "factory-style" coaching centers where students are just faces in a crowd of hundreds, Plutus IAS limits its batch sizes to 40–50 students. This ensures that every aspirant receives individualized attention and can clear doubts in real-time.

Holistic Mentorship: Sankalp Sarthi
The institute’s flagship Sankalp Sarthi program has redefined mentorship. With unique features like 4 AM discipline sessions, dedicated personal mentors track your daily progress, evaluate answer writing, and provide the emotional resilience needed for the UPSC journey.

Expert Faculty & Success Rate
Led by luminaries like Dr. Huma Hassan, the faculty consists of PhD holders and former bureaucrats who focus on conceptual clarity. This expertise has resulted in a remarkable success rate, with over 50% of students from recent batches qualifying for the next stages of the exam.

Future-Ready Learning
Whether you prefer offline classes in Delhi or the flexibility of interactive online sessions, their hybrid model ensures you never miss a beat. For anyone serious about their 2026 attempt, Plutus IAS is undeniably the best IAS coaching in India.
